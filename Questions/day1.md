## Question:
Given three positive integers X, Y and P. Here P denotes the number of turns. Whenever the turn is odd X is multiplied by 2 and in every even turn Y is multiplied by 2. The task is to find the value of max(X, Y) รท min(X, Y) after the complete P turns.  

## Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case follows, a single line of the input containing three integers X,Y and P.  

## Constraints:
1<=T<=100  
1<=X<=Y<=P<=1000  

## Sample Input:
2  
1 2 1  
3 7 2  

## Sample Output:
1  
2
